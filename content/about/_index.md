Equally at home with ethereal renaissance polyphony and challenging works of the present day, The Tudor Consort is one of New Zealand’s premier chamber choirs.

Since its inception forty years ago with founding Music Director Simon Ravens, The Tudor Consort has been dedicated to artistic excellence, authentic performance practice, and above all moving its audience through the art form of a cappella choral music.

Prizewinners at two editions of the Tolosa International Choral Competition, the choir is regularly recorded and broadcast on Radio New Zealand Concert. Highlights of its history have included critically-acclaimed performances of Handel’s _Messiah_ and JS Bach’s _Christmas Oratorio_ and _St Matthew Passion_, as well as frequent collaborations with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and Orchestra Wellington.
