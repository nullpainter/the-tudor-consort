Equally at home with ethereal renaissance polyphony and challenging works of the present day, The Tudor Consort is one of New Zealand’s premier chamber choirs.

Since its inception forty years ago with founding Music Director Simon Ravens, The Tudor Consort has strived for artistic excellence, authentic performance practice, and above all to move its audience through the art form of a cappella choral music.

Prizewinners at two editions of the Tolosa International Choral Competition, other highlights of its history have included critically-acclaimed performances of Handel’s _Messiah_ and JS Bach’s _Christmas Oratorio_ and _St Matthew Passion._ The choir is regularly recorded and broadcast on Radio New Zealand Concert, and is frequently invited to collaborate with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and Orchestra Wellington.
