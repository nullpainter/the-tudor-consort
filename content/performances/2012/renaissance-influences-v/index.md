Claude le Jeune and Olivier Messiaen continue the ‘Renaissance Influences’ theme. The rhythmic detail and structure found in the delightful chansons of le Jeune’s collection *Le Printemps* directly inspired Messiaen’s *Cinq rechants*, the last of his trilogy of works celebrating the myth of Tristan and Isolde. This concert acknowledges the 20th anniversary of Messiaen’s death in 1992.
