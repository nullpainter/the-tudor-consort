For those who enjoyed the dense polyphony of Tallis’ *Spem in alium*, you must not miss this performance of Brumel’s intricate *Missa Et ecce terrae motus*. The nickname derives from the melody on which the Mass is based, a small section of a plainsong chant to the words ‘Et ecce terrae motus’ (‘And the earth moved’). Given the obvious association with the Canterbury earthquakes, The Tudor Consort will record this Mass shortly after the concert, with all profits going to the music department of ChristChurch Cathedral.


**This concert will be presented in Palmerston North on Saturday May 12 at 6.30pm at St Patrick's Cathedral, 197 Broadway Avenue.**
