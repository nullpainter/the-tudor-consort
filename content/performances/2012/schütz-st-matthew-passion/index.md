Written in his eighties, the seemingly austere a capella writing belies a deep emotional reaction to the familiar text, and is an obvious precursor to Bach’s famous works."

Written in his eighties, the seemingly austere a capella writing belies a deep emotional reaction to the familiar text, and is an obvious precursor to Bach’s famous works. Watch this space for 2013!
