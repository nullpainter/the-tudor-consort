director = "Simon Ravens"
teaser = "England of the 16th century was not a safe place for Catholics. Byrd himself was publically accused of being a practising Catholic on a number of occasions, when to be so was a treasonable offence punishable by death. Fortunately, connections with those in high places ensured that he and his family escaped relatively lightly. Even so, Byrd's music for the Catholic Service would have been performed in the utmost secrecy, in a private house by only a handful of singers."

England of the 16th century was not a safe place for Catholics. Byrd himself was publically accused of being a practising Catholic on a number of occasions, when to be so was a treasonable offence punishable by death. Fortunately, connections with those in high places ensured that he and his family escaped relatively lightly. Even so, Byrd's music for the Catholic Service would have been performed in the utmost secrecy, in a private house by only a handful of singers. Typically, these works are emotionally charged and deeply personal, often focusing on the individual's suffering.


This performance was also performed on 21 February 1992 in Palmerston North and on 22 February 1992 in Wanganui.
