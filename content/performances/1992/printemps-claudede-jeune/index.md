Claude de Jeune ranks as one of the most original composers of the Renaissance. His expressive harmonic language and gifts as a melodist can easily disguise the striking novelty of his approach to rhythm and large-scale structures. Printemps is a collection of 39 spring chansons encompassing a variety of vocal scorings, from three to eight voices, and an equal variety of moods, from delicate bergerettes to comic rustic and "animal" chansons. Such was its power to move that during his lifetime Le Jeune's music was jealously guarded by his musical circle in Paris, and only published after his death. This performance was given with the singers sitting around a circular table and surrounded by the audience.
