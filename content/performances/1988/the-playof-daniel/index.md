At the Picardy town of Beauvais, New Year's Day in the 13th century must have been a remarkable occasion. Known as the Feast of Fools, January 1 was the day when each year the sub-deacons (the junior clerics) were allowed to rule the Cathedral. Not only did the sub-deacons take this as an opportunity for indulging in their sense of the ridiculous - a donkey procession being one example - they also promoted the performance of a full-scale drama, the anonymous *Play of Daniel*.


All this was housed in the new cathedral at Beauvais which after 1272 was (briefly, until it collapsed) the tallest cathedral in Europe.


This costumed and semi-staged performance of *The Play of Daniel* was part of the 1988 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts.
