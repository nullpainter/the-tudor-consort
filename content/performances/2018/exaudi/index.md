We are delighted to welcome Andrew Joyce, Principal Cello of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, in a programme of moving choral music with soaring cello obbligato. A sense of farewell underpins this programme. John Tavener’s *Syvati* is a setting of an Eastern Orthodox funeral text, with the cello taking the part of the Ikon of Christ. Canadian composer Jocelyn Morlock’s *Exaudi* is her own highly personal response to Tavener’s work, while Richard Rodney Bennett’s *A Farewell to Arms* reﬂects on the fading glory of military victory, youth, and life itself. This is also a wonderful opportunity to hear Andrew Joyce perform Bach’s radiant fourth solo cello suite in the beautiful ambience of St Mary of the Angels.
