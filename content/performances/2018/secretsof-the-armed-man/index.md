In the mid 15th century, a jaunty French tune became the most popular song in Europe, found its way into over 40 settings of the Latin Mass, and is still being used today. Where did ‘L’Homme Armé’ come from? Was it just the name of a tavern, or a secret message to an elusive order of knights? At the same time, Constantinople, the last vestige of the Great Roman Empire, fell to the Ottoman Turks, and all of Europe mourned. What was the connection? The Tudor Consort explores ‘L’Homme Armé’ in its many guises, ancient and modern, and visits Byzantium in its ﬁnal days.
