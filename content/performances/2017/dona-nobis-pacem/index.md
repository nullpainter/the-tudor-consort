To mark the International Day of Peace on September 21, The Tudor Consort presents a concert of music with a peace theme, including Arvo Part’s *The Beatitudes* and settings of the Agnus Dei by Palestrina, Byrd and Josquin. We are particularly thrilled to premiere Gemma Peacocke’s recent commission *Pacific* which sets to music the words of famous New Zealand peace campaigners.


Featuring *Pacific* (Commission by Gemma Peacocke for piano, four hands and electronics)
