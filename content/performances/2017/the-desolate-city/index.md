A recital of choral music commemorating the wartime destruction of Dresden and Hiroshima, and the cry of the persecuted Catholic mourning the loss of the spiritual Jerusalem in a violently Protestant England. Featuring Byrd’s haunting *Civitas sancti tui,* Mauersberger’s hymn of mourning to his beloved Dresden Wie liegt die Stadt, and Jack Body’s anguished setting of Psalm 137 (*By the waters of Babylon*), his last commissioned work for The Tudor Consort.
