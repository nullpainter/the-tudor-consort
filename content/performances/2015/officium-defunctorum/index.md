The Tudor Consort presents a liturgical reconstruction of Victoria’s beautiful *Officium Defunctorum*, interspersing the choral movements with chanted Propers for the Feast of All Souls. Victoria wrote the Requiem in 1603 after the death of his patron, the Empress Maria, for whom Victoria had served as personal chaplain for 17 years. This is a wonderful opportunity to experience a performance of this work in its original context.
