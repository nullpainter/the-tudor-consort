#### 
***Richard Wistreich with The Tudor Consort***


More than any other, the Bass voice was singled out for special treatment by the English composers of the 17th century. Dramatic sections of the text were often reserved for a bass soloist, who was required by the music to possess a remarkably wide vocal range. The outstanding quality of this music is itself evidence of the importance composers attached to their music for bass soloist and chorus. This programme includes some of the most spectacular examples of the bass verse anthem - works by Tomkins and Wise, as well as three of the pieces Purcell wrote for the famous Chapel Royal singer John Gostling. In addition, *The Tudor Consort* will also sing four of the finest full choir anthems of the Restoration period - pieces by Locke, Blow, Purcell and Thomas Tomkins, whose elaborate 12-part masterpiece *O Praise the Lord* will be receiving its first New Zealand performance.
