In the Middle Ages the term "carol singing" had a much wider usage than it does in the 21st century, applying as it did to virtually any song in which verses alternate with a "burden" (refrain).


There is more to the lullaby than meets the eye. Not only does the form have a long history, but examples of lullabies can be found in many different cultures. The character of a lullaby can also be more varied than might first be thought.
