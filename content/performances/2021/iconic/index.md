The Tudor Consort presents a sumptuous feast of Russian Orthodox music, focusing on music by the ‘Holy Minimalists’ Arvo Pärt and John Tavener, alongside music written specifically for the Russian Orthodox liturgy by Sergei Rachmaninov and Georgy Sviridov.


Movements from Rachmaninov’s beloved *All-night Vigil* and *Liturgy of St John* will feature, including the well-known *Bogoroditse Dyevo*.


NZSO Principal Cello Andrew Joyce will join the choir to perform Tavener’s *Svyati*. In the words of the composer, “The cello represents the Priest of Ikon of Christ, and should play at a distance from the choir...As in Greek drama, choir and priest are in dialogue with each other.”
