The trial and crucifixion of Christ, marked each year in the period before Easter known as Holy Week, inspired some of the finest music of the Renaissance. Beginning with the joyous procession of Palm Sunday and proceeding through the anguish of the Crucifixion to the first report of the empty tomb on Easter Sunday, The Tudor Consort leads you in a meditation of music for Holy Week. Featuring Gregorio Allegri's famed setting of the *Miserere*, Antonio Lotti’s *Crucifixus*, and interwoven with J. S. Bach’s renderings of Lutheran chorales, this promises to be a spiritually transcendent evening.
