Two baroque masterpieces feature in this programme which could not be more contrasting in style and dramatic perspective. Guest Conductor Matthew Leese comments, "although both texts deal with human mortality, the audience is certain to be transported in very different ways."


The first great German composer to enjoy international fame, Schütz inspired many of the later composers from his homeland including JS Bach and Johannes Brahms. The *Musikalisches Exequien* were composed for the funeral of Count Heinrich Posthumous Reuss in 1635. The work is a combination of biblical verse and poetic meditations, alternately utilising chorale settings and virtuosic, emotionally vivid solo passages with masterfully transparent continuo pairings.


Scarlatti's setting of the *Stabat Mater* is an underestimated gem, composed in 10 parts, with vastly contrasting textures, exquisite suspensions reminiscent of Lotti's 'Cruxifixus' and vocal writing which is as sublime to sing as it is to listen to.


Guest Conductor Matthew Leese grew up in Palmerston North and completed his undergraduate degree at Otago University. He is currently based in the United States where he serves on the Voice and Opera faculty at Millikin University. He has founded three critically acclaimed ensembles, including the professional early music ensemble 'Gravitación'. Matthew is Co-Artistic Director of the New Brunswick Early Music Festival, Director of Music at First Presbyterian Church of Urbana, and he is currently pursuing a Doctorate in Choral Conducting at the University of Illinois.


The Tudor Consort will be joined for this performance by Emma Goodbehere (cello), Richard Hardie (bass), Douglas Mews (organ), and Donald Nicolson (harpsichord).
