Review of The Tudor Consort’s Palmerston North performance  

Manawatu Standard, March 29 2010


 


The Tudor Consort presents Renaissance settings of The Lamentations of Jeremiah, including Tallis’s famous work, juxtaposed with a rarely performed setting of 20th Century composer Ernst Krenek. Written in 1941 while in exile in the United States, Krenek combined the strict polyphony of the Renaissance style with 20th Century dodecaphony to produce a compelling protest against the horrors of war.
