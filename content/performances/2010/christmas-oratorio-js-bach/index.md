Celebrate Christmas with The Tudor Consort! Following on from their hugely successful and critically-acclaimed performance of [Messiah](http://tudor-consort.org.nz/concert/2008/handels-messiah) in 2008, The Tudor Consort is delighted to present JS Bach's popular *Christmas Oratorio*.


The Christmas Oratorio tells the Nativity story through music of great joy and virtuosity, the work famously opening with powerful strikes of the timpani.


Once again, The Tudor Consort will perform with forces close to those that Bach would have written for.


[Michael Stewart](http://www.tudor-consort.org.nz/director/michael-stewart), referred to as "surely the best young choral conductor in Wellington, and arguably New Zealand" (Garth Wilshere, Capital Times), leads the performance with the Vector Wellington Orchestra and soloists Anna Leese (soprano), Kate Spence (alto), David Hamilton (tenor), and Jared Holt (bass). “The Christmas Oratorio is one of those works that I have always wanted to tackle,” says Stewart. “We are very much looking forward to performing this exciting and uplifting work with such a stellar line-up of soloists.”


Internationally renowned opera singer Anna Leese returns to New Zealand to perform the soprano arias. After her stunning debut at Covent Garden in 2007, she was heralded by The Tribune as “a flawless jewel, polished and ready to be placed in whatever crown the fates have prepared for her”, while The Times described her has “one potential star in the making”. She was last heard here in the role of Tatyana in NZ Opera’s production of Eugene Onegin last year, in which she was widely acclaimed, the Dominion Post noting that “in Anna Leese, Tatyana has an advocate to rival the great Russian singers”.


We look forward to seeing you at this very special performance.
