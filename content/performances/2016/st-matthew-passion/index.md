Along with the aptly-named *Schwanengesang* (swan song), his epic setting of Psalm 119, Schütz’s three settings of the Passion can be considered the valedictory works of the grand old man of German music. Written in his eighties, the seemingly austere a cappella writing belies a deep emotional reaction to the familiar text of Christ’s arrest and cruciﬁxion, and is an obvious precursor to Bach’s famous works. Former Music Director Peter Walls leads the choir for their annual atmospheric Good Friday presentation.
