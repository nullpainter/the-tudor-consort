Many will have experienced Janet Cardiff’s installation at the Wellington City Gallery last year; now is your chance to hear this epic work of the Renaissance with a live choir. *Spem in Alium* has not been performed in Wellington since The Tudor Consort’s 20th anniversary in 2006. This time, we will present it alongside its presumed precursor: the 40-part motet *Ecce beatam lucem* by Italian composer Alessandro Striggio. Tickets to this concert will be limited, so ensure a seat by purchasing a subscription!
