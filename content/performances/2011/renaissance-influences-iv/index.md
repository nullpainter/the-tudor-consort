Two world premieres by leading New Zealand composers Ross Harris and Jack Body feature in our upcoming concert – *Renaissance Influences IV – Made in New Zealand*.


The well-known Thomas Tallis motet *If ye love me* is recontextualised by Harris in his work, *Vobiscum in aeternum*, while Body’s Hebrew setting of *Psalm 137* takes the otherworldly strains of Orthodox Russian chant as its starting point.


The remainder of the home-grown programme includes works by Dame Gillian Whitehead, David Farquhar, Douglas Mews and Tudor Consort choir member Anna Griffiths. The performance is part of the REAL New Zealand Festival 2011.
