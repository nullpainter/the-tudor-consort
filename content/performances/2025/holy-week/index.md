_In the midst of life we are in death&hellip;_

Join us at Wellington Cathedral of St Paul on Good Friday to hear John Sheppard’s expansive and moving _Media vita in morte sumus_. This Lenten antiphon has been sung as part of the evening service of Compline since the Middle Ages, and this particular setting is a monument of the English renaissance repertoire, requiring immense vocal stamina. We will perform this alongside the poignant Lamentations of Jeremiah by Thomas Tallis, as well as works by Thomas Weelkes, Orlando Gibbons and William Byrd. A truly Tudor programme!
