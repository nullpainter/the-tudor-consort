Join us at our concert with Orchestra Wellington on Saturday 22 November. 
The Artist Repents features Victoria Kelly’s Requiem, winner of the
2023 SOUNZ Contemporary Award. 

> Requiem is a work that I’ve been contemplating for 30 years. I think it exists because I’ve never been able to find words for the events that inspired it — the death of my parents; the loss of friends; the experiencing, witnessing and sharing of grief; the advent of love; the birth of children; the beauty and hostility of the world; the wonder of the universe… - Kelly
