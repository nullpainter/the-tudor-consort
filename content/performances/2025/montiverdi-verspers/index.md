We are thrilled to be performing Monteverdi’s iconic _Vespro della Beata Vergine_ in the stunning acoustic of St Mary of the Angels. This is an immense and groundbreaking work, juxtaposing Renaissance melodies with the virtuosity and colour of the Baroque orchestra and blending intimate solos with vast choral-orchestral textures.

Featuring a full baroque orchestra, The Tudor Consort will be joined by early music specialists including acclaimed international artists.

Don’t miss the rare opportunity to hear this masterpiece played live!
