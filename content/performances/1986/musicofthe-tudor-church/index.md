The history of the Tudor Church, from Henry’s infamous break with Rome to the eventual Anglican Church of Elizabeth is a complex patchwork of reformation and counter-reformation, idealism and ignorance, personal ambition and political treachery. It therefore comes as no surprise to find that the church music of the Reformation period is particularly diverse in both style and religious content.


This performance of music of the Tudor Church was *The Tudor Consort’s* inaugural performance.
