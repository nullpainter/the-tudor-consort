We crown the year with two of the greatest choral works of all time - Tallis’ *Spem in alium* and the legendary *Mass for Double Choir* by Swiss composer Frank Martin. Famously locked away in a drawer for nearly forty years, Martin considered his Mass “*to be a matter between God and myself*” - it is now considered one of the most beautiful and finely-wrought settings of the 20th Century. *Spem in alium* requires little introduction - Tallis’ incredible 40-part motet has not been heard in Wellington since The Tallis Scholars performed it in 2013.
