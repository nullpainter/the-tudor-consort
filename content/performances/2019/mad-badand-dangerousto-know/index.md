From micturating organists through to murderous princes, this programme takes a look at repertoire from some of the less law abiding composers throughout history, as well as those who, due to their political or religious leanings, were indeed ‘dangerous to know’. Featuring Gesualdo (of course), Weelkes, Byrd and Gombert.


  

We are delighted to present this concert with the one of Wellington’s newest vocal ensembles: Aurora IV. Described as ‘polished, scrupulous and finely nuanced’ and singing music that spans the centuries, Aurora IV is a male voice quartet comprised of four of New Zealand’s most experienced choral musicians.
