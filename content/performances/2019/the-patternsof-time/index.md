Throughout history, and particularly with the Franco-Flemish School of the 14th and 15th centuries, composers have been trying to outdo each other with complex canons and patterns to show off their learning. Join The Tudor Consort as they explore some of the crowning achievements in this field, including Ockeghem’s famed *Missa Prolationem*, Tallis’ ‘crab-canon’ *Miserere nostri*, and works by Brahms and Jack Body."
