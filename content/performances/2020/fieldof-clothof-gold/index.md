Jousting, fountains of wine, an enormous tent city and over a thousand crumpets… The Tudor Consort marks the 500th anniversary of one of the most incredible summits to have taken place between two heads of state: the Field of the Cloth of Gold meeting of Henry VIII of England and François I of France. Alongside the tournaments and the pomp there was plenty of music, with each King bringing their own musical retinue to outshine the other. This concert explores music that may have been presented at this meeting, featuring composers Jean Mouton, Claudin de Sermisy, Robert Fayrfax and William Cornysh, as well as music by Henry VIII himself.
