During the 16th century the whole issue of music in the church was addressed by the Council of Trent, who were understandably concerned about the number of popular secular melodies which were finding their way into Mass settings of composers. The reformists were also anxious that the texts of the Mass should no longer be obscured by too much musical elaboration. Although Pope Marcellus only reigned for three weeks before his untimely death, he took the opportunity of addressing the Papal Choir (of which Palestrina was a member) in 1555 and registered his own disapproval of such musical defects. Perhaps this event explains the dedicatory title of the Missa Papae Marcelli, which seems to adhere to the recommendations of the Council of Trent. It is symptomatic of Palestrina's genius that he was able to satisfy the demand for a more direct musical style without abandoning his natural refinement and conservatism.


With this 1987 performance *The Tudor Consort* introduced to New Zealand the concept of liturgical reconstruction. Director Simon Ravens' notes on the concert begin, "In order that we might understand and appreciate a 16th century Roman Mass it is perhaps necessary that we view it in its historical and social context". The group [repeated this concert](http://tudor-consort.org.nz/concert/2001/missa-papae-marcelli) to celebrate its 15th birthday in 2001.
