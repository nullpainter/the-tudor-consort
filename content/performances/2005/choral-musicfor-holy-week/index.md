The season of Lent, and the week leading up to Good Friday in particular, has inspired some of sacred music’s finest composition. This meditation through music presents a selection of the Renaissance’s most moving music for Lent by that period’s finest composers, plus new repertoire for Holy Week by 20th century composers as diverse as Edward Bairstow, Arvo Pärt and New Zealand composer David Farquhar. As the sun sets and the light fades, the German chorales from Bach’s St Matthew Passion return between each polyphonic piece as a litany to the life of Christ.
