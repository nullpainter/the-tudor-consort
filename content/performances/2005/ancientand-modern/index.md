On October 25, members of *The Tudor Consort* departed for Europe to represent New Zealand in a key choral competition in Spain and to perform concerts in venues in Austria and Italy. These two pre-tour performances give you an opportunity to support the choir and hear the beautiful programme of sacred and secular repertoire by English, European and New Zealand composers that the choir will sing abroad.
