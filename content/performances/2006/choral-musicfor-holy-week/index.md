The season of Lent, and the week leading up to Good Friday in particular, has inspired some of sacred music’s finest composition. This meditation through music presents a selection of the Renaissance’s most moving music for Lent by that period's finest composers. As the sun sets and the light fades, the plaintive calls of Thomas Tallis’s mesmerising motet *Miserere Nostri* return after each set of pieces as a litany to the life of Christ.
