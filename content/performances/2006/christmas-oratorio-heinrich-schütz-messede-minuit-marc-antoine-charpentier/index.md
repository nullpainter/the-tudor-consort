Soloists *Baroque Voices*, period instrumental ensemble *Academia Sanctae Mariae* and *The Tudor Consort* join forces for this delightful programme of Baroque Christmas music, including Schütz’s powerfully dramatic *Christmas Oratorio*.


Charpentier’s *Messe de Minuit* for choir, solo voices and strings is famous because Charpentier uses for its themes the melodies of popular French carols. Schütz’s Oratorio blends trumpets, recorders and strings with choir and solo voices to tell the Christmas story in its famous episodes of the three Kings, the Angels appearing to the Shepherds, and the infant in the manger.
