#### 
***Orlande de Lassus 1532?-1594 Alfonso Ferrabosco the Elder 1543-1588***


The evening tradition of Vespers as we know it today is one of the oldest of the Catholic church, dating back to the sixth century. This late evening concert in the ethereal acoustic of Wellington Cathedral intertwines polyphonic works suitable for Vespers by Ferrabosco and Lassus alongside plainsong psalms and hymns, and includes premiere New Zealand performances of two spectacular works by Lassus: the mighty six part *Magnificat Praeter Rerum Seriem* and the touching *Stabat Mater* for two solo quartets, one of upper voices and one of lower voices.
