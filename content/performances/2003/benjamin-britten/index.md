***Benjamin Britten 1913-1976***


A very special performance of Britten's works conducted by Sir Philip Ledger.


Sir Philip Ledger studied Music at King's College Cambridge; he was later Director of Music there from 1974-82. During this time he was also conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society.


As an Artistic Director of the Aldeburgh Festival from 1968 until 1988 Sir Philip was involved in a number of performances of Britten's works. He has accompanied some of Britain's leading singers: including Robert Tear and John Shirley Quirk. Retiring recently after 20 years as Principal of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, Sir Philip's work in Music has been acknowledged with honorary Doctorates conferred by four Universities.


Sir Philip remains active in performance, as well as Chairman of the English Chamber Orchestra Charitable Trust, Chairman of the Music Advisory Board for the Caird Awards and serving on the Boards of the Cheltenham Arts Festivals and of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.
