***Canticles of Light: Bob Chilcott***


This exciting programme of modern repertoire for voices and instruments includes the New Zealand premiere of one of the most important new choral works of the 1990s plus new compositions by New Zealand composers.


Described by *The Guardian* as "The most exciting young British composer to have emerged in the 1990s", James MacMillan's music is notable for its extraordinary directness, energy and emotional power. *The Tudor Consort* collaborates with contemporary orchestra *GateSeven* in the New Zealand performance of MacMillan's powerful cantata *Seven Last Words from the Cross*.


Additional repertoire in this programme includes Bob Chilcott's *Canticles of Light*, an introspective motet sequence for double choir and organ, plus exciting new works for voices and instruments by honours students in composition at the School of Music at Victoria University of Wellington.
