The season of Lent, and the week leading up to Good Friday in particular, has inspired some of sacred music's finest composition. This meditation through music presents a selection of the Renaissance's most moving music for Lent by that period's finest composers, including the authentic Sistine Chapel reconstruction of Gregorio Allegri's famous *Miserere mei, Deus*, and Thomas Tallis's masterful *Lamentations*. As the sun sets and the light fades, the haunting beauty of the plainsong hymn *Pange Lingua* ("Sing, my tongue") returns between each polyphonic piece as a litany to the life of Christ.
