A thank-you to our loyal supporters, this informal concert is a special extra for our **subscribers only**. Come and meet the choir over a drink and let us serenade you with some favourite madrigals and motets, themed around that most magnificent substance—wine!


This will be a fun and informal performance, with songs full of bawdy humour. The lighter side of some of the Renaissance period's most esteemed composers will be showcased, including Orlande de Lassus, Henry Purcell and Thomas Ravenscroft.
