The six motets of JS Bach are some of the most vibrant, glorious and timeless choral works in the repertoire. The Tudor Consort will perform three of them—*Singet dem Herrn*, *Jesu, meine Freude*, and *Lobet den Herrn*—to be contrasted with settings of the same texts by different composers. This will be a wonderful way to celebrate the beginning of the festive season.
