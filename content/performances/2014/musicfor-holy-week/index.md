Some of the most stunning treasures of Renaissance music are explored in this Lenten programme for Holy Week, featuring superb settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah by Thomas Tallis, Orlande de Lassus and the Portuguese Manuel Cardoso. Alongside John Browne's epic setting of the Stabat Mater, one of the masterpieces of the Eton Choirbook,  The Tudor Consort will also perform William Byrd's motet *Ne irascaris Domine,* a plaintive text that can be read as a cry of despair from a persecuted people in Protestant England*.*
