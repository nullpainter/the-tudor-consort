We complete a very busy anniversary season with a special performance of Handel's Messiah with the NZSO, led the internationally-acclaimed conductor and virtuoso harpsichordist Erin Helyard. We will be joined by four international soloists: Samantha Clarke, Ashlyn Tymms, Kyle Stegall, and Andrew O'Connor.
