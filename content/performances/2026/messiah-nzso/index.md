We complete a very busy anniversary season with a special performance of Handel’s _Messiah_ with the NZSO, led by the internationally-acclaimed conductor and virtuoso harpsichordist Erin Helyard. We will be joined by four international soloists:  Samantha Clarke, Ashlyn Tymms, Kyle Stegall, and Andrew O’Connor.
