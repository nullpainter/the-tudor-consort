Our very first performance took place at Wellington Cathedral of St Paul on 23 April 1986. Our fortieth birthday celebration concert features Tudor music from that performance, alongside Thomas Tallis' celebrated forty-part motet Spem in allium, and the New Zealand premiere of Jaako Mäntyjärvi's Tentatio, a-forty part work written as a homage to Tallis, describing Christ's forty days of temptation by the Devil in the wilderness. We are delighted to be collaborating with director Jacqueline Coats, and also with a number of Tudor Consort alumni, who will join us for this special concert.
