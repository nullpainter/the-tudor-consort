Following on from our performance of _Requiem_ in November 2025, we are delighted to be involved in another premiere by Orchestra Wellington’s 2026 Composer-in-Residence, Victoria Kelly. Kelly made a transformative journey to the Antarctic as part of Antarctica New Zealand’s Community Engagement Programme. She was moved by the experience of living in an unimaginably beautiful and mysterious place, within a community of people who collaborate peacefully to better understand the world.

The result is an opera adapted from the 1961 novel _Solaris_ by Stanislaw Lem. _Ocean_ explores the limits of human knowledge as a group of scientists try to understand the nature of a vast, sentient ocean on the surface of an alien planet. In Lem’s novel, the ocean of Solaris holds up an indifferent mirror to the people who are studying it – and they struggle to cope with what is reflected back to them.
