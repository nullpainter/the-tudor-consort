Leonard Bernstein’s Chichester Psalms were composed at the invitation of Dean Walter Hussey for the 1965 Southern Choirs Festival, adding to the music-loving priest's impressive list of commissioned works, 
alongside Britten’s _Rejoice in the Lamb_ and Finzi’s _Lo the Full Final Sacrifice_. We are thrilled to collaborate once again with our friends at Orchestra Wellington, following on from our previous 
performances of Berg’s _Wozzeck_ and Victoria Kelly’s _Requiem_.
