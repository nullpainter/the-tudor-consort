Leonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms were composed at the invitation of Dean Walter Hussey for the 1965 Southern Choirs Festival, adding to the music-loving priest's impressive list of commissioned works, alongside Britten's Rejoice in the Lamb and Finzi's Lo the Full Final Sacrifice. We are thrilled to collaborate once again with our friends at Orchestra Wellington, following on from our previous performances of Berg's Wozzeck and Victoria Kelly's Requiem.
