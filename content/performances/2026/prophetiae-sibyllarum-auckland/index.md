Orlando de Lassus’ _Prophetiae Sibyllarum_ features some of the most wildly chromatic and forward-looking music of the Renaissance period. The Tudor Consort presents the original work that forms the basis of Michael Norris’ [SoundCathedral](../sound-cathedral) from our March 1 Aotearoa Arts Festival Concert, alongside favourites anthems and motets from Tudor England by Byrd, Tallis and Gibbons.
