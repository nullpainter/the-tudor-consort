We are very much looking forward to performing in Auckland for the first time, and to join forces with Baroque specialists NZ Barok. Antonio Lotti's well-known Crucifixus a 8 forms a part of his Credo in F - come and experience this wonderful work alongside Let thy hand be strengthened, one of Handel's beloved Coronation Anthems.

We will perform a [solo programme](../prophetiae-sibyllarum/) in Auckland featuring the wildly chromatic and forward-looking Prophetiae Sibyllarum of Orlando de Lassus.
