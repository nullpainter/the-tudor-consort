The Tudor Consort is proud to present Georg Frederic Handel’s masterpiece *Messiah* on Thursday 4 December in the Wellington Town Hall, in conjunction with the Vector Wellington Orchestra and a quartet of talented young soloists led by Madeleine Pierard, under the direction of Music Director Michael Stewart.


Handel’s *Messiah* has delighted audiences worldwide since its premiere in Dublin in 1742. It has enjoyed a long and varied performance history, ranging from the original small-scale performances to the huge blockbuster presentations of the Victorian era. The Tudor Consort joins forces with players from the Vector Wellington Orchestra to present *Messiah* with the smaller forces that Handel intended, with the dramatic momentum of the operatic stage never far away. 25 voices, 22 instruments, and a quartet of soloists led by 2005 Lexus Song Quest winner Madeleine Pierard, will make for a breathtaking performance that you will not forget.


The Tudor consort presents Handel’s *Messiah* with soloists Madeleine Pierard (soprano), Nicola Hooper (alto), Edmund Hintz (tenor), and Hadleigh Adams (bass), with the Vector Wellington Orchestra directed by Michael Stewart.
